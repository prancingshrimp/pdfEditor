# pdfEditor
Python and tkinter powered tool for rearranging, splitting and merging of pdf files.

It is a nice alternative for shareware or freeware pdf tools especially for colleagues behind restrictive firewalls.
For properly working some ghostscript files are necessary: gsdll32.dll, gsdll32.lib, gswin32c.exe
